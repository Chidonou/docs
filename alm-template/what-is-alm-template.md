# What is ALM Template

### Concepts

* ALM-template is a json formatted configuration file which defines your cloud-native application's architecture design and runtime configuration.
* ALM-template is cloud platform stateless. You write your template once and it works on any cloud platforms such as AWS, AliCloud, OpenStack, etc.  _\(We're still in the process of releasing more platform integrations, it might be the case that certain cloud platform support documented here but hasn't covered in the released open source code yet.\)_
*   * You can save and reuse ALM-template at anytime.
